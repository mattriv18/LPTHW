#prints the text in the quotations
print "I will now count my chickens:"

#prints the text in quotations and does
#the operation after the comma
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

#prints the text in quotations
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

#prints the solution to the operation
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

#prints all the text in quotations including
#the numbers
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

#3+2 is not less than 5-7 so it prints whether this statement
#is true or false
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

#prints the stuff in quotes then does the expression after the comma
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7", 5 - 7

#once again prints stuff
print "Oh, that's why it's False."
print "How about some more."

#prints stuff then says if the inequality is
#true or false after the print
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
